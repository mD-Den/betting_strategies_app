        "1X on home outsiders strategy",
        '''
        
  A betting strategy that has been successful in the past is the bet on the “double chance” 1X if an outsider plays against a favorite at home. In this case, the “1X” bet brings respectable odds and very interesting profit opportunities.

  Home win or draw betting strategy

  You don’t even have to choose and analyze games that contain absolute extremes and obvious class differences with this strategy. So, you don’t necessarily have to bet against Barcelona, Bayern or Juventus as an away team. Here, we would probably move away from the value bets. Even if we opt for teams that are not big outsiders, but are still outsiders according to the odds, we find highly interesting odds between 1.60 and 2.50.

  As with all bets, it is important to analyze in advance and not blindly going for any team. You should of course take statistics into account, advance information about injuries and suspensions, as well as the current shape of the teams. The home advantage of the outsider, for whom games in front of their own audience against a “bigger one” also represent a special motivation, should not be underestimated as it brings another small advantage for the home team. Especially when the respective favorite has recently shown itself shaky against “smaller ones”, you can definitely find value in such an outsider bet with double chances.

  If you also accept lower odds, you can of course also use this 1X strategy for games that have balanced odds.

        "All-in on odds at 1.20 strategy",
        '''
        
  This betting strategy involves winning numerous bets one after the other and always using the maximum offers the opportunity to earn decent money. But it is also clear that all the money is gone if you lose a bet. But if you manage to win 30, 35, maybe even 40 times in a row, you’ll get big money!

  All-in on odds at 1.20 – betting strategy

  We use odds around 1.20 for this – ideally you should look for the bets you are playing live. As with the strategy of betting over 1.5 goals in what is estimated to be typical “over” games, you can wait here until the odds have reached the desired level. The over 0.5 bet is ideal here – i.e. the bet that the game will not end 0-0. Usually, after goalless 30 minutes, you get a rate of 1.20 – depending on the match, this can of course be lower, but sometimes even higher. Of course, it is a matter of taste with which type of bet you want to monetize your betting sequence, or money race‘ as it is also called.

  It is important that you always play roughly the same odds. This is certainly a test of patience and not particularly spectacular at first, but there is no exact goal and you can stop at any time and have your winnings paid out. For example, if you start such a series of bets with a stake of 10 €, that’s all you can lose. So you now find a bet with odds 1.20, win it and immediately play the 12 € you won again on odds that are around this amount. You win 14.40 € – which will be invested in the next bet.

  The profits will only become noticeable very slowly, but will increase sharply over time, because of course the stake grows higher and higher. If you actually manage to get 30 picks right in a row, your 10 € from the beginning will already be a whopping 2,373.76 €. After 35 correct pick we would already be at 5,906.68 € and after 40 correct picks at 14,697.71 €.

  Of course, it is far from likely to have so many tips in a row right – but this progressive betting strategy is also something for the thrill. If you do not start the betting sequence with too high a stake, you cannot lose much and there is of course the possibility of starting a real streak when employing this betting strategy.

        "The 1-3-2-6 System",
        '''
        
  The 1-3-2-6 system is similar to another positive progression betting system known as a Paroli. Both involve increased stakes after a win, and both involve a cycle of bets ending at a fixed point. The only real difference is the actual betting sequence.

  There are not many systems that are easier to understand than 1-3-2-6 and its simplicity is very appealing to many players. There are also a number of other benefits that contribute to its popularity.

  Of course, as in any betting system, there are also disadvantages. We explore the positive and negative aspects of the 1-3-2-6 below, along with the details and how it is used.

  Use of the 1-3-2-6 system:

  Like many betting systems, the 1-3-2-6 was designed for bets that pay out an even sum, like the red-black bets in roulette. In fact, it is widely used on the roulette table and in other casino games such as baccarat, dice games and blackjack. Basically, it doesn’t matter what you use it for, provided you are playing with even sums.

  As mentioned earlier, this is a very simple system. All you have to do is adjust your bets based on a few simple rules. First of all, you have to decide how high your betting unit should be. As a guide, once you’ve set the amount you’re willing to lose in one session, your betting unit should be around 2% to 5% of that.

  For example, if you wanted to play with a total of 500 €, 10 € would be a reasonable number. A bet unit is the amount you wager on the first bet in the sequence. After every lost bet, the sequence ends and you start a new one – and again you insert a betting unit.

  If you win a bet, you adjust your stake according to the sequence 1-3-2-6. So, if you win your first bet, the next time you increase your stake to € 30 (three betting units). If you win this too, you will place € 20 on your next bet. If you win this too, the next time you wager € 60. And already we have the 1-3-2-6 sequence.

  If you win the fourth, consecutive bet then the sequence is completed and you start all over again. Don’t forget, as soon as you lose, your stake will also reset to a betting unit.

  This is basically what the 1-3-2-6 betting system is all about. As long as you keep the simple set of rules in mind, you shouldn’t have any problems using this system successfully.

  Possible outcomes of 1-3-2-6

  Since this system is only a short cycle, there are few possible outcomes. These are the following:

    - Loss of the first bet (total loss of one betting unit)
    - First bet won, second bet lost (total loss of two betting units)
    - First two bets won, third bet lost (total win of two betting units)
    - Won the first three bets, lose the fourth bet (breakeven)
    - Win all four bets (total win of 12 units)
    - So, as you can see, only two of the possible outcomes of a cycle involve loss. A loss will only occur if the first or second bet is lost. So, every time you win the first two bets, you cannot lose again in the same cycle.

  It may seem like the 1-3-2-6 system makes it more likely to make money than to lose. But unfortunately, this is not true. Unfortunately, while the system has some advantages, the guaranteed profit isn’t one.

  Advantages and disadvantages of the 1-3-2-6 betting strategy

  Perhaps the greatest advantage of 1-3-2-6 is that it is very simple and easy to learn. If you want to use a betting system that you don’t want to be overly complicated, this is a good option. In addition, your stake is not increased after a loss – this prevents the rapid loss of money, especially if you choose the size of your betting units sensitively.

  Another notable advantage is that after stopping the sequence after four consecutive wins and then going back to one unit, you are facing the possibility of a small winning streak. There is a chance that you will win all four times in a row – and if you are lucky, your winnings will exceed the losses on bets you lost before.

  The system does not come without its disadvantages; the most striking is that there is nothing to beat the house edge that exists in any casino. No betting system can do this. But it helps you to maintain discipline with a set of rules to be followed, because ultimately you still have to rely on your luck to win. If you get the wrong sequence of results, you will lose.

  The 1-3-2-6 isn’t a bad betting system compared to any of the other systems available, provided you accept it for what it is. This system doesn’t guarantee that you will win, but it can help you get the most out of your luck.

        "Bet live on over 1.5 goals",
        '''
        
  For example in relation to late goals betting, look for games with a clear favourite with 3-way winning odds of less than 1.30. In a betting round, spread the risk over as many games as possible; obviously, there will always be some unexpected losses. Then, bet on late goals for each of these games. Most bookmakers offer these bets under the name “Last goal will be in minutes 76-90”. Statistically, you will win just under 60% of all of these bets.

  It is also important to note that you only ever play single bets. With a combination, no matter how temptingly high value it might have, your chance of winning drops drastically.

  Live betting on “over 1.5 goals” is a very lucrative betting strategy. This bet has an interesting advantage due to the development of the odds. First of all, you should do the same thing as with normal over / under bets. Find a game where you expect an over 2.5. Only use this betting strategy for bets where you expect this.

  Before the game, the odds of an over 1.5 will be very low. In some cases, it is no higher than 1.20. But while the game is running and the goals are missing, this rate increases almost every minute and becomes more and more lucrative. Now you have to be patient. Ideally – as with any bet – you should watch the game live at the same time in order to have the greatest possible advantage.

  Now wait until the bet has odds between 1.50 and 2.00. The higher the better, but of course the timing is important. If a goal is scored, the bet is over before it has even started and you have to find a new game. This strategy only works if it is 0-0 long enough. Usually, you will have to wait until the 35th to 55th minute so that the odds on the over 1.5 are fair. However, we recommend that you still bet in the first half – it is important that the odds are 1.50 or higher.

  You analyzed the game before kick-off and expected an over 2.5. If you’re not completely wrong, goals will still be scored here. And we are eagerly awaiting the first goal as soon as the bet is played.

  If a goal is scored quite early after your bet, then you have – at least with most bookmakers who allow this – a profitable exit strategy: The odds for the over 1.5 will of course rattle off after the first goal. Now you can have the bet paid out via cashout, you can virtually “sell” it. You will definitely get out with a plus.

  The riskier option is to wait for the second goal and win the bet anyway. Here it is of course advisable to watch the game live. If there is a goal in the air, you can still wait and let the bet stand. If the game is a tense affair, then it may be better to sell the bet.

  In any case, for such a strategy it is advisable to bet with a betting company that allows a live cashout option. For more information on the subject of live betting, see also the live betting section of our page.

        "Sports betting on cup games",
        '''
        
“As a matter of principle, I don’t bet on cup games”; the above is often heard, but never really understood, because spectacular cup fights in particular offer so many opportunities for the sports bettor.

It is not uncommon for David to meet Goliath. In relation to the big club, it is not rarely an annoying duty, but for the small club it is the undisputed game of the year. And thus, now and then, there is the chance to win good odds and value bets.

It can be worthwhile to prepare more closely for cup games. In times of YouTube and dynamic club websites, it is in many cases not a problem to follow the press conference before the game; which players will be included in the squad for the game? Which regular players or even stars are spared? Is the second goalkeeper playing? Will young players get their chance? All of the above are interesting questions when looking for a lucrative bet.

Of course, it always depends on the club’s approach – cup games are always a question of mentality. It is therefore a good idea to analyze the past few weeks. Does a larger club need to rehabilitate for weak games within the past weeks and maybe would like to let off steam on a “little one” in the cup? How cup-affine is a club in general? There are enough examples of quite large clubs that have suffered from a cup curse for years or even decades. Yes, in fact there is hardly any other even, where you there are more to analyze than in cup competitions.

The advantage, however, is that there will be numerous bets that, on closer inspection, will pass as value bets. Even if the bookmakers, probably because they cannot plan and pre-analyze every game themselves, keep the odds lower in the cup and pay a lower commission.

But this is not the case everywhere either. Especially cup games, in which various bookmakers set different commission rates, offer an extensive comparison of odds. This in turn offers a good opportunity to get to know a new bookie, perhaps to open a new account in order to be able to use an even wider range of odds in the future.
